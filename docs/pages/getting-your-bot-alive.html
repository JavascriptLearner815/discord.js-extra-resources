            <h1>Getting your Bot Alive</h1>
            <p>
                Before you can start coding, you need to create
                your bot app <a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>
                by clicking "New Application". You can then give your application a name, 
                description, and an icon. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To create the bot user you will need to use,
                click on the "Bot" section to the left. Then, all you
                need to do is click the button to create a new bot user.
                From here, you can change the bot's username, tweak its 
                settings, and give it a snazzy avatar.
                For now, make sure "Public Bot" is off, because you only
                want yourself to be able to invite it while you
                develop it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now it's time to add it to your own server. 
                Be sure to make a server designated to testing
                this bot so you can test it privately, then invite your bot.
                To get your bot's invite link, go <a href="https://discordapi.com/permissions.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and paste your
                client ID into the client ID field from your application's 
                "Application" section. Copy the link at the bottom of the page
                and paste and search it into your browser. Then, choose
                the server you made for the bot, accept the permissions you chose
                from the permissions website you just used, and complete the CAPTCHA.
                Finally, just click "Authorize".
            </p>
            <p>
                Click the "Copy" button under "Token" in the "Bot" section. 
                Don't worry if you accidentally close the bot application manager,
                you can always go back to the link mentioned above to go back.

                <strong>
                    Your token is how your bot will log in to Discord.
                    If someone else gets hold of it, they can do anything
                    you can to affect the bot's behavior. If you making
                    a GitHub repository for this, please make a 
                    <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files#configuring-ignored-files-for-a-single-repository" target="_blank".gitignore file</a> for security.
                    If it does get leaked, go to your bot app's "Bot" 
                    section in the manager and click "Regenerate" and
                    confirm <em>immediately</em>. 
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                It's time to code! Go back to your terminal and run
                `code-insiders .`, or whatever command your text editor uses.
                Create a file named `index.js` and another named `config.json`. 
                Copy & paste this code into `config.json`:
                <code><pre>
                    {
                        "prefix": "!",
                        "token": "your-token"
                    }
                </pre></code>
                You can replace the prefix value of "!" to whatever you want.
                The prefix will be used at the beginning of all of your bot's 
                commands. Replace the "your-token" value with your token, copy it
                from your app's "Bot" section. 
                <strong>
                    Remember <em>not</em> to commit
                    `config.json`, as it contains your token. Commiting your
                    `index.js` file is fine as it doesn't expose your token 
                    in your repo code.
                </strong>
                In your `index.js` file, copy & paste the following code:
                <code><pre>
                    const { token } = require("./config.json")

                    const { Client } = require("discord.js")

                    const client = new Client()

                    client.once("ready", () => {
                        console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`)
                    })

                    client.login(token)
                </code></pre>
                Save both of these files with CTRL + S, then go 
                back to your terminal and run `node index.js`. If you
                see your bot in the "online" members list, and 
                "Logged in as " followed by your bot's username and tag, you're
                ready to move on!
