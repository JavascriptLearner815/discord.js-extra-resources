            <h1>Install Node.js and Discord.js</h1>
            <p>Now that you know how this guide works, let's get into actually creating and coding the bot!</p>
            <p>
                Create a folder on your computer and name it what you want the name of the bot to be e.g. Memey Bot.
                You could also create a GitHub repository for it and clone that. You would need to add a .gitignore file if you were to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Open your computer's terminal, and then navigate to the folder you just created.
                For example, C:\Users\dspee\OneDrive\Documents\Tutorial Bot.
                After you have the folder open in your terminal, run `node -v`. 
                If something like v14.7.0 pops up, you're good to go!
                If it doesn't, download Node.js from <a href="nodejs.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the official website</a>. 
                Finally, check `npm -v`. If you don't get a version number, oops!
                You probably installed Node.js improperly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Run `npm init` in your terminal. You can enter all the information it asks for,
                half of it that it asks for, or none. If you don't type a response, it will
                be set to the default setting (the one in the parentheses).
                After this, you can run `npm install discord.js`. 
            </p>
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/ftt3dZK.png" alt="npm install warns">
            <p>
                Your terminal will probably look something like this. 
                You might have a ton of more warns than what I have, too!
                They are all entirely optional, though, as they're just "warns". 
                Next, it's time to create, invite it and start coding!
            </p>
